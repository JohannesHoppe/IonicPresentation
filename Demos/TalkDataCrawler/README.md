A simple crawler to get the events from the "MDC - Mobile Developer Conference kompakt 2014" page.

## Fetch packages and run

2. cd to TalkDataCrawler
3. `npm install`
4. `node start`


## Visual Studio

Is not required. But i like the IDE, so you might want to give the [Node.js Tools for Visual Studio](http://nodejstools.codeplex.com/) a try.
